Hi there and welcome to my first Adobe XD plugin! It's a simple tool that basically came from my own personal needs while using the product. When having multiple artboards, sometime's it's necessary to keep track of their sizes and it can be a real pain to add them manually. My simple plugin will allow you to easily overwrite or add sizes to the artboard title, making it a breeze to export them consistently.

{% include webp.html
webp = "/assets/images/post/adobe-xd-plugin-add-size-to-artboard-title.webp"
legacy = "/assets/images/post/adobe-xd-plugin-add-size-to-artboard-title.png"
alt = "Adobe XD - Add Size to Artboard Title plugin"
%}


[You can fork it on Github](https://github.com/vphilot/xd-add-artboard-dimensions) or hit me up on social media for suggestions. Happy artboarding!
