profile: Thank you for stopping by! You can call me <strong>Vini</strong> and I love building experiences for the web. I believe everything we do together should be accessible and inclusive.
motto: ! all work, no BS &mdash; we're kind &mdash; we're helpful &mdash; we respect each other's time &mdash; we build something to be proud of &mdash; <a href="https://www.ruinedby.design/" target="blank">Ruined by Design</a>
bg: I fell in love with interactive design a long time ago. I started building simple websites for friends and family using Flash when I was 17 years old, using a very rudimentary implementation of ActionScript2 I had learned by myself. Since then, I expanded my interests and broadened my skillset, but the drive behind all that is still pretty much the same.
