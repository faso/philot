profile: Thank you for stopping by! You can call me <strong>Vini</strong> and I love building experiences for the web. I believe everything we do together should be accessible and inclusive.
motto: ! all work, no BS &mdash; we're kind &mdash; we're helpful &mdash; we respect each other's time &mdash; we build something to be proud of &mdash; <a href="https://www.ruinedby.design/" target="blank">Ruined by Design</a>
bg: I fell in love with interactive design a long time ago. I started building simple websites for friends and family using Flash when I was 17 years old, using a very rudimentary implementation of ActionScript2 I had learned by myself. Since then, I expanded my interests and broadened my skillset, but the drive behind all that is still pretty much the same.
tools:
  - HTML5
  - Sass
  - JavaScript
  - Vue
  - React
  - Sketch
  - XD
apps:
  - I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for all things web related and I love it. I've used Atom before but I think VSCode is just faster and easier to customize.
  - My preferred theme is <a href="https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code/" target="_blank">Dracula</a> with <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank">Fira Code</a>.
  - I use MacOS's default Terminal and I'm not a hardcore command line user, but I love <a href="https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/5987629" target="_blank">using aliases</a> and I can't recommend them enough.
  - My browser is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/nightly/all/" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly</a> because I love their developer tools and the fact that it doesn't eat up so much battery (I'm looking at you, Chrome). 
  - I use a Macbook Pro and my favourite MacOS productiviy tools are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12" target="_blank">Copyclip</a> and <a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/" target="_blank">Magnet</a>. Being a Windows user for most of my life, the window snapping feature is a must.
  - <s>I love Android and my OnePlus 6T is as fast as I would like any phone to be.</s> I fully surrendered to Apple and now I have an iPhone. I kind of love it and iOS feels mature enough that I don't miss most things about Android at this point. Still a work in progress.
facts: 
  - ! Brazilian, born in a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LevuqobMVP5SAVeP8" target="blank">tiny little town</a> amid the Atlantic Rainforest, grandson of farmers, and proud of every single tiny victory I've accomplished.
  - I was a certified Architect abroad (with a Masters!) before moving to the Creative Technology field. I carry a lot of analytical thinking and design strategy/planning from the great experiences I had back then.
  - I am a biker, a gamer, an avid reader, and an amateur watecolourist. 
  - I hate Cilantro, I can't even explain how much I hate it.
